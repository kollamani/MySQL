Creating INDEX statement in sql is used to create indexes in tables.
The indexes are used to retrieve data from the database more quickly than others.
The user can not see the indexes, and they are just used to speed up queries/ searches.
Note: Updating the table with indexes takes a lot of time than updating a table without indexes. It is because the indexes also need an update.
So, only create indexes on those columns that will be frequently searched against.

use College;
show tables;

select * from EMP_INFO;
Create Index Syntax:
    Create Index <Index_Name> on table (<Column_name>)

Q. Create Employee Data whose salary is more than 8000.
create index salary_index on EMP_INFO (salary asc);

select * from EMP_INFO where salary>8000;

-- Create a unique index
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_unique_column ON tablename(columnname);

-- Add an index when creating a table
CREATE TABLE tablename (
    id INT,
    name VARCHAR(50),
    INDEX idx_name(name)
);

To view the indexes:
    SHOW INDEX FROM table_name;
    SHOW INDEX FROM employees;

DROP Index:
    DROP INDEX idx_columnname ON tablename;

Example:
Let's say you have a table called employees with an index named idx_lastname on the last_name column.
To drop that index: 
    DROP INDEX idx_lastname ON employees;
